    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>
I opted for Netlify as my hosting service due to its robust features and straightforward approach.<br>
The free plan impressed me with offerings like automated Git deployment, an integrated Content Delivery Network (CDN), and SSL certification.<br>
These features, crucial for secure and efficient website management, were available without any cost.<br>

The free plan's inclusivity, allowing for multiple team members and hosting numerous websites, made Netlify a practical choice for my initial projects.<br>
The paid plans, with their scalability and added functionalities, ensure a smooth transition as my projects grow.<br>

Netlify's transparent pricing structure and user-friendly interface simplify the hosting experience.<br>
In essence, Netlify stands not just as a hosting service but as a reliable partner, facilitating the progression of my web projects from simplicity to sophistication.

The reasoning for my decision to colour code the cells as red for the website is due to my feeling that the paid version should provide more than it offers<br>
Pro version simply does not provide enough features except Bandwidth speed of 1TB which is very exceptional for the price in comparison with other providers like InfinityFree<br>
On the other hand paying $19 per member seems like a very high price to me however i may be wrong if the feedbacks are taken into accounts which in this case are not<br>
Finally the size of 500 Websites seems more than enough and therefore i dont think the number needs to be increased however with the pro version it would be nice if the number <br>
Would have gone up by at least 100 websites considering the payment which the user makes
